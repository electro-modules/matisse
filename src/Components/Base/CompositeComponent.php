/**
 * A component that delegates its rendering to a separate template (either internal or external to the component),
 * which is parsed, compiled and (in some cases) rendered by a view engine.
 *
 * <p>Composite components are composed of both a "source DOM" and a view (or "shadow DOM").
 *
 * <p>The source DOM is the set of original DOM subtrees (from children or from properties) provided to the component
 * on the document by its author. It can be used to provide metadata and/or document fragments for inclusion on the
 * view. This is the DOM that simple (non-composite) components work with.
 *
 * <p>Composite components do not render themselves directly, instead they delegate rendering to a view, which parses,
 * compiles and renders a template with the help of a view engine.
 *
 * <p>The view engine can be Matisse, in which case the view is compiled into a "shadow DOM" of components that can
 * render themselves, or it can be another templating engine, which usually is also responsible for rendering the
 * template.
 *
 * > <p>**Note:** Matisse components on the view can, in turn, be composite components that have their own templates,
 * and so on recursively. **But** the rendered output of a composite component must be final rendered markup, it can
 * not be again a template that requires further processing.
